.START

Another room. Is there going to be another riddle?

.THE-DOOR

It is the same story again. The scribbling says "Dance on the floor".

Hmm, dancing.

.DONT-TOUCH-WALLS

I don't think I should touch the walls again. I should probably
investigate the ground.

.PRESSED

A low humming noise comes from... the downside?

.FLICKERED

I swear I heard something just now.

.LOST

The noise is gone! I wonder if there's some pattern to follow.

.UNLOCKED

A screeching sound probably means the door is unlocked now.
