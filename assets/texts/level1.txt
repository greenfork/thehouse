So this is the house. I finally arrived here.

I can't believe I'm finally here, I can't wait to see my old friend Evan.
He sent me a letter inviting me in for a couple of weeks.

But where's everyone? I arrived a day earlier, maybe they didn't anticipate
my arrival so soon.

I'll leave my luggage here and try to find someone.
