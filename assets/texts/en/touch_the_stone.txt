.START

The door shuts with a loud noise! It was half-open before and now it looks
like it is locked.

The wind chills my feet, it is getting really stronger here.

I should quickly find someone before I catch a cold.

.THE-DOOR

The door looks locked. But there's a scribbled text on it that says
"Touch the stone". Touch what?

.UNLOCKED

A crackling noise of poorly oiled lock screeched somewhat unexpectedly.

I guess the door is open now.
