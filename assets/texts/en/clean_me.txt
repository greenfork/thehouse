"YOU.."

What?!!

"YOU CLEAN THIS ROOM"

"YOU TAKE MY TRASH"

"YOU PUT IT AWAY"

"YOU WALK"

The deafening voice stopped as suddenly as it started.

.THE-DOOR

I guess I should take out the trash?

.TRASH

I should find somewhere to put it...

.TWO-TRASH

I can't take more, I should put out the one I already have first.

.BIN

This is the bin I should take out the trash to.

.TAKE-OUT

Alright, one piece of trash less.

.TAKE-OUT-2

Another one done!

.DONE

"GOOD"

"COME"

Oh God, I almost forgot about this voice.
