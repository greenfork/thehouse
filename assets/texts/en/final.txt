"COME"

"YOU DESERVE A REWARD"

"OR RUN AWAY AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FRIEND AGAIN"

The dark end of the room gets lit. In a dim light some kind of a stone
table appears next to the wall.

...

Should I go there?

.TRY-EXIT

Should I really quit while I can?

.EXIT

The door opens and lets me out.

I will forget this as a bad dream and will never come back to this house.

.CLOSER

Approaching with a shivering heart I see a strange figure slowly appearing
on the stone table.

.STONE-TABLE

On the stone table there's a body, hardly recognizable as a human.

The roots coming from the stomach, to the ground, look like giant roots of a tree.

And the face is too familiar, this is my old friend Evan!

"YOU HAVE COME FOR YOUR REWARD"

"YOU WERE GOOD TO ME AND I AM GOOD TO YOU"

"YOU TOUCHED MY STONE, YOU DANCED ON MY GROUND, YOU CLEANED MY CHAMBERS"

"YOU CAN MEET YOUR FRIEND NOW"

"HE WAS GOOD TO ME TOO"

"AND HE CONTINUES TO BE GOOD"

"AS WILL YOU"

Listening to this mesmerizing voice I didn't notice the roots slowly wrapping
my feet and pulling me down.

"I have to get out!" - my brain screamed at my paralized body.

I can't do anything. I'm stuck.

Please, God, help me!

...

I screamed and screamed. Until my lungs had no air in them. And then everything
turned black.

"YOU WILL BE GOOD..."
