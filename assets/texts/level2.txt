.START

This looks like the only open door. I guess I should go further.

I will take the lamp because I can barely distinguish the other end
of this corridor.

.CORRIDOR

This corridor descends downhill pretty steeply,
do they have something underground like a cellar?

.TUNNEL

This looks more like a tunnel. The walls are made of sand and gravel.

It feels cold. Persistent breeze blows down the tunnel.
