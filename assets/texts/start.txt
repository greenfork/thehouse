You arrive to a small house many miles away from the old town of Arkham.

It is located among other old and crumbling houses, but this one is not
as desperately in need of love as others. It is mostly fine, maybe just
looks a bit old.

In the old days there was a salt mine, the driver says, but now only
Richardson family lives there.
